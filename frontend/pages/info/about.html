                <p class="mb-4" data-i18n="info.about.mission.p1">Turathya connects discerning collectors with
                    exceptional pieces through carefully curated timed auctions. We specialize in antiques, fine art,
                    rare books, ceramics, and collectibles of historical and aesthetic significance.</p>
                <p class="mb-4" data-i18n="info.about.mission.p2">Our platform combines the ease of online bidding with
                    the rigor and expertise of traditional auction houses. Every item offered is evaluated by
                    specialists and presented with detailed condition reports and provenance documentation.</p>

                <p class="mb-4" data-i18n="info.about.approach.p1">We believe quality trumps quantity. Rather than
                    flooding bidders with endless listings, we focus on thoughtful curation. Each auction consists of
                    items selected for their authenticity, condition, and cultural value.</p>
                <p class="mb-4" data-i18n="info.about.approach.p2">Timed auctions allow participants from around the
                    world to bid at their convenience, while maintaining the competitive dynamics and transparency of
                    live sales. Bidding periods are clearly defined, increments are standardized, and all activity is
                    recorded.</p>

                <p class="mb-4" data-i18n="info.about.trust.p1">Every piece is accompanied by comprehensive
                    documentation including high-resolution images, detailed descriptions, condition assessments, and
                    available provenance. We disclose all known restorations, repairs, and flaws.</p>
                <p class="mb-4" data-i18n="info.about.trust.p2">Buyer's premium and fee structures are clearly outlined.
                    Payment terms, shipping arrangements, and return policies are established before bidding begins. We
                    operate with the same standards of accountability expected from established auction houses.</p>

                    arts, Asian ceramics, rare books and manuscripts, fine art, and antique jewelry. Items are evaluated
                    for authenticity, condition, and market value before being accepted into our auctions.</p>
                <p class="mb-4" data-i18n="info.about.expertise.p2">We work with independent experts, restorers, and
                    appraisers when specialized knowledge is required. Third-party authentication and appraisals are
                    obtained for high-value items or uncertain attributions.</p>
